- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdeford330
- 👀 I’m interested in authoring IF adventure games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and using the Alan interactive fiction language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but you never can tell what lies beyound the next bend in the river of life.
- 📫 How to reach me: currently running under the radar. Maybe later.
